# Email CC Configuration for Odoo

This module extends Odoo’s email workflow by letting administrators configure **global default CC recipients** for business documents.  

With this module, companies can ensure that certain partners (e.g. a shared mailbox, compliance team, or manager) are always copied on outgoing transactional emails.

## ✨ Features

- **Global CC toggle**  
  Enable/disable global CC recipients from *Settings → General Settings*.

- **Partner selection**  
  Select one or more `res.partner` records (must have an email) as global CC recipients.

- **Automatic CC population**  
  If enabled, the chosen partners are automatically added to the **CC field** when sending:
  - Invoices & Credit Notes
  - Sales Quotations & Confirmations
  - Sales Order Cancellations
  - Purchase Orders & Requests for Quotation
  - Stock Pickings (Shipping Emails)

- **Fallback behavior**  
  If the feature is disabled or no partners are selected, the CC field falls back to the responsible user:
  - Salesperson for Sales Orders
  - Buyer for Purchase Orders
  - Invoice User for Invoices
  - Responsible User for Pickings

## 🔄 Technical Details

- Global settings are stored in `ir.config_parameter` under:
  - `cc_bcc.enable_custom_partner`
  - `cc_bcc.custom_partner_ids` (comma-separated partner IDs)
- All affected wizards (`account.move.send`, `mail.compose.message`, `sale.order.cancel`, `validate.picking.email`) check these parameters in `default_get()`.
- CC partners are injected into the wizard’s `cc_email_partner_ids` before sending.

---

## 🛠️ Compatibility

- Depends on `mail` and standard business apps (`sale`, `purchase`, `account`, `stock`).
